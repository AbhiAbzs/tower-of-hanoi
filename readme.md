# Tim's Towers of Hanoi

## What's All This About?
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic math game/puzzle. The object of the game is to move the tower from one column to another, folling these three rules:
  1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  1. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
  1. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## What's it Made Of?
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a whole lotta help from jQuery)

## How Did You Do It?
For this project, I really wanted to take advantage of some of the basics we've been learning about Object Oriented JS. Although we haven't gotten as far a constructor functions, etc., I know that structuring my game as an object could make this project a lot more manageable.

I started by coding up a 4-block stack and the game board itself. It didn't take long for me to settle on the 8-bit theme, transforming the game board into an arcade cabinet. 

When it came time to add functionality, I began by defining a few methods I knew I would need: `checkMove`, `moveRing`, `checkWin`, and `gameOver`.
